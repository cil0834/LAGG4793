#' Multivariate Shiny App
#'
#' @description There are a total of six widgets that control the three graphs.
#' The first graph is a clickable y vs. x plot of the data.
#' When a point is clicked on the plot the drop-one correlation of the data is output.
#' The first plot also has a linear regression aspect to it as well if the linear regression widget is toggled
#' The second graph is also a y vs. x plot of the data, however, there is a widget that rotates the data
#' and the correlation of the data is output as the graph is rotated.
#' The final graph is simply a three dimensional graph of the data.
#' The first widget is a widget that asks for a csv file of data.
#' The second widget controls the x-axis of the graphs that are output. In other words, the value that is
#' selected by this widget controls what column is used for the x axis of the graphs.
#' The third widget control he y-axis of the graphs. And it functions similarily to the x-axis widget.
#' The fourth widget controls the z-axis of the last graph only.
#' The fifth widget determines if the first graph has a linear regression line and equation or not
#' The sixth widget controls the angle that the second plot is rotated
